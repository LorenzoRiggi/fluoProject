FluoDetect is one of the results of the thesis work carried by the author of this text.
The author felt the need for a more comprehensive and easy to use application for his studies in fluorescence spectroscopy.
Most of the applications available to this day for fluorescence analysis have huge databases filled with fluorescent elements of any kind, from those present in organic compounds such as bacteria (such as tyrosine or tryptophan) to inorganic compounds.
These applications mainly allow the user to search for fluorescent elements by name and to compare those by means of graphic plots that overlap the spectra of said fluorescent elements.
