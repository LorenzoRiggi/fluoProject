The compound could be Curcumin. Curcumin is a yellow pigment derived from turmeric, a spice commonly used in curries. It is a photosensitive compound that fluoresces with peak wavelengths around 540 nm when excited near 430 nm, which matches the given peak wavelength close to 538.552 nm. 

Its fluorescence is due to the presence of conjugated double bonds. Curcumin has shown potential in various studies for therapeutic applications in diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, arthritis, and other chronic diseases due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is also used as a pH-indicator in borax and as a complexometric indicator in EDTA titration. 

From a technical aspect, Curcumin under UV light emits fluorescent light which is used for imaging purposes in biological studies and food sciences because of its ability to bind with various proteins and other biomolecules. 

Remember, while this information narrows down the potential compound to Curcumin, definitive confirmation would require more detailed spectral analysis or other laboratory methods.
