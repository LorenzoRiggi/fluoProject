Yes, the user is correct. The characteristics specified match the Fluorescein compound. Fluorescein is a synthetic organic compound that is highly fluorescent, and it is often used as a dye or as a biochemical reagent. Its peak emission wavelength falls around 515-520 nm, thereby aligning well with the specified peak emission wavelength. Its spectral width or Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) also aligns with the given data, as the FWHM can change based on the specific environmental conditions but lies within the given range. This compound is widely used in medicinal chemistry for angiography and fluorescent labeling of biological specimens. Keep in mind that precise FWHM values can vary based on conditions such as pH, temperature, and concentration.
