The characteristics of peak wavelength and full width at half maximum (FWHM) you provided closely match those of Chlorophyll-a, a vital photosynthetic pigment found in plants and algae.

Chlorophyll-a absorbs light primarily at the wavelength of 430-662 nm in the blue and red light regions, while it emits fluorescence around the peak wavelength of 673-683 nm. It plays a key role in photosynthesis by allowing plants to absorb energy from light. The primary role of chlorophyll-a is to convert light energy into chemical energy, which is then used for the process of photosynthesis. In this conversion process, light energy absorbed by chlorophyll-a promotes electrons to a higher energy state, and these high-energy electrons then drive the synthesis of glucose from water and carbon dioxide, with the release of oxygen. 

Its broad emission line in the red region contributes to the observed green color of most plants.
